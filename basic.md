### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">**A. The Jamestown Colony**

The colony’s leadership changed repeatedly, its inhabitants suffered an extraordinarily high death rate, and, with the Virginia Company seeking a quick profit, supplies from England proved inadequate. 

i. New arrivals (including the first two women, who landed in 1608) brought the numbers up to 400 in 1609, but by 1610, after a winter long remembered as the "starving time," only 65 settlers remained alive.

ii. The Virginia Company slowly realized that for the colony to survive it would have to abandon the search for gold, grow its own food, and find a marketable commodity.

iii. Instead of retaining all the land for itself, the company introduced the headright system, awarding fifty acres of land to any colonist who paid for his own or another’s passage.

### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">**B. Powhatan and Pocahontas**

At one point, Smith was captured by the Indians and threatened with execution by Powhatan, only to be rescued by Pocahontas, reputedly the favorite among his many children by dozens of wives. 

i. Most acknowledged the rule of Wahunsonacock, a shrewd and forceful leader who had recently consolidated his authority over the region and collected tribute from some thirty subordinate tribes.

ii. In the first two years of Jamestown’s existence, relations with Indians were mostly peaceful and based on a fairly equal give-and-take.

iii. Called Powhatan by the settlers after the Indian word for both his tribe and his title of paramount chief, he quickly realized the advantages of trade with the newcomers.

### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">**C. The Uprising of 1622**

Virginia forced a treaty on the surviving coastal Indians, who now numbered fewer than 2,000, that acknowledged their subordination to the government at Jamestown and required them to move to tribal reservations to the west and not enter areas of European settlement without permission. 

i. The settlers’ supremacy was reinforced in 1644 when a last desperate rebellion led by Opechancanough, now said to be 100 years old, was crushed after causing the deaths of some 500 colonists.

ii.  Once it became clear that the English were interested in establishing a permanent and constantly expanding colony, not a trading post, conflict with local Indians was inevitable.

iii. Investors had not turned a profit, and although the company had sent 6,000 settlers to Virginia, its white population numbered only 1,200 when the king assumed control.

### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">**D. A Tobacco Colony**

Virginia’s white society increasingly came to resemble that of England, with a wealthy landed gentry at the top; a group of small farmers, mostly former indentured servants who had managed to acquire land, in the middle; and an army of poor laborers—servants and landless former indentured servants—at the bottom. 

i. Despite harsh conditions of work in the tobacco fields, a persistently high death rate, and laws mandating punishments from whipping to an extension of service for those who ran away or were unruly, the abundance of land continued to attract migrants.

ii. The expansion of tobacco cultivation also led to an increased demand for field labor, met for most of the seventeenth century by young, male indentured servants.

iii. Of the 120,000 English immigrants who entered the Chesapeake region during the seventeenth century, three-quarters came as servants.

### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">**E. Women and the Family**

A widow or one of the few women who never married could sometimes take advantage of her legal status as a feme sole (a "woman alone," who enjoyed an independent legal identity denied to married women) to make contracts and conduct business. 

i. In the colonies as in England, a married woman possessed certain rights before the law, including a claim to dower rights of one-third of her husband’s property in the event that he died before she did.

ii. The high death rate, unequal ratio between the sexes, and late age of marriage retarded population growth and resulted in large numbers of single men, widows, and orphans.

iii. Given the demand for male servants to work in the tobacco fields, men in the Chesapeake outnumbered women for most of the seventeenth century by four or five to one.

### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">**F. The Maryland Experiment**

The charter granted him "full, free, and absolute power," including control of trade and the right to initiate all legislation, with an elected assembly confined to approving or disapproving his proposals. 

i. Maryland was established in 1632 as a proprietary colony, that is, a grant of land and governmental authority to a single individual.

ii.  The second Chesapeake colony, Maryland, followed a similar course of development.

iii. As in Virginia, tobacco came to dominate the economy and tobacco planters the society.

### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">**G. Religion in Maryland**

 Further aggravating instability in the colony was the fact that Calvert, a Catholic, envisioned Maryland as a refuge for his persecuted coreligionists, especially the younger sons of Catholic gentry who had few economic or political prospects in England. 

i. As tobacco planters engrossed the best land later in the century, however, the prospects for landless men diminished.

ii. Unlike in the older colony, freedom dues in Maryland included fifty acres of land.

iii. But at least initially, Maryland seems to have offered servants greater opportunity for landownership than Virginia.
